7,"3rd year doing this thread...

I'll post mine, but first a story that should probably have fallen into why i love chess from a week ago.

Long story warning and heavy game annotation warning. 

I played the North American Open for the first time ever this year. It involved an early morning flight to vegas (leaving my house at 6 am  east coast time or 3 am vegas time). I drop two games right off the bat on arrival. Combined with my half point bye i reconsider why I play chess if I am going to spend all the money and travel to be so stupid. That night i stay up until 4 am vegas time, making it 25 straight hours of being awake, reloooking at my simple blunders with an engine (a no-no I'm aware, but I'm masochistic sometimes), then dropping 150 points on lichess bullet because why not. 

I sleep two hours, wake up, eat something absurdly unhealthy, and enter with the goal of making a kid and their parents cry while grinding them slowly in a winning position as revenge for blowing my +6 position against a kid who looked at his dad after every single one of my fucking moves.

Joke was on me of course, I didn't get any more kids for the tournament. Still, for reasons unknown and maybe better unknowable, I play better when I'm playing with malice. 

I win both my games the next day, but I'm already out of the money, just trying to salvage some pride and not embarrass myself really. The wins were unsatisfying (though the doctor who told me ""fuck you"" as he resigned was satisfying in a sort of sadistic way). 

The last day comes, and I win after my opponent loses a piece to a tactic, and in spite of having recovered to 3.5/6, I continue to question my commitment to chess, having gone down in rating over the past two years in spite of all peripherals being higher. 

I wonder if it's really worth it to pour in energy after yet another cheating scandal that was conveniently overlooked in the open section. (not naming names but it was the talk of all the players that after this kid who was an FM had their monroi break they magically lost in five moves flat then got blown off the board in the next round after being mandated to notate with pen and paper... but only after going 5.5 out of 7 in the first round and having stockfish help them grab a norm). 

I wonder how good I'm ever going to get and if I even enjoy the process of improving anymore as it's no longer learning much new but more just beating tactics into my head over and over as I've pretty much gone as high as you can go while still blundering shit regularly and until I stop that shit I am not hitting 1800 or whatever.


So on to round 7 for the 2nd straight round i get a top seed in my section, someone just under the section cutoff. Just playing for pride really. 

My opponent surely felt the same, having probably been more disappointed than me about being out of the money.

And this is where the game of maybe my life begins.

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 c6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Nc3 f5 {This is apparently a
playable move. I had never seen it in a slow game before, and was already out
of book. I spent a while here trying to figure out the merits and if I could
punish it directly in short order. After a 5 minute think I just decided to
play normal chess moves.} 6. Bf4 Nf6 7. Qc2 Be7 8. e3 {My opponent was already
using quite a bit of time, starting on move 2 even. Time control was 2 hours
for the first 40 moves but there was also a 30 second delay so you basically
had almost 3:30 per move. Here I am trying to make Nbd7 hard to play.} Ne4 9.
Be2 {Bd3 was a consideration. With f5 on the cards I am not keen to take on e4
and just give him a pawn chain leading all the way to the open f-File for what
is sure to be a rook. I already felt the aggression and in my opponent,
the one native I played, a somewhat older, grizzled guy, who could have passed
off as a slightly younger Mike Ehrmentraut. He wanted to take out his anger on me and now we'd have a proper game.} O-O 10. O-O Bf6 {I was quite
happy to see this move. In spite of playing these structures often I don't get
many chances to really execute a proper minority attack at my level, and here
was a sign that b4 and b5 were going to come in short order.} 11. b4 Be6 12.
Be5 {Probably at least a minor inaccuracy by me. The problem was after b5
black could play c5 and my long black diagonal would be an absolute disaster.
I also had potential weaknesses on the c file from my b4 push, so I wanted to
at least solve one problem before getting in b5. Unfortunately, I think black
has a number of pleasant choices here.} Nd7 13. Bxf6 {My opponent continued to
use alot of time. He can retake the bishop in five(!) different ways. I
offered a draw 5 minutes into his thought process. This was mostly for
psychological reasons. Again, we were both out of the money. In some sense, I
would be happy to play but also wouldn't mind resting for the blitz tournament
and the draw would secure a score over 50%. But my opponent declined the draw.
Viktor Korchnoi talked about the decliner of the draw offer often feeling
obligations to push harder for a win than before, and my opponent's next move
was one I had seen but was still a surprise.} gxf6 $5 {Well now we know he
really wants to attack. If not on the f file then the g file it would seem.
the pawn on f6 is doubled but covers squares my knight may want to visit, and
with the white squares blocked up I don't see a way to the king, where it's
possible Kh8 followed by approximately 7 heavy pieces on the g file might be
coming at me. I had seen Re1, Bf1 and g3 type stuff thinking I'd have time if
need be but this was now going to be potentially a violent war.} 14. b5 {I
continue with my original plan, seeing nothing on the king side, and a center
kind of locked up, and figuring i had time to defend my own king. I was scard
of pawn sac ideas my opponent might try with f4 down the road, but that
appeared needless for now.} Rc8 {A strong move. I cannot take now because c3
would hang, after a rook recapture, and I can't take on e4 super easily
because it just gives him a potentially big attack with initiative. So I
decided to temporarily sac a pawn.} 15. Qb3 Nxc3 16. Qxc3 cxb5 17. Qb4 Qb6 $1 {
I think this was the best move on the board. I had no interest in an immediate
recapture, as I was looking at Qd6 if a6 was played and trying to start
getting my own kingside play against the damaged structure. I had originally
thought I would play Qe7 if Qb6 was played, but once Qb6 was played I realized
Qe7 was utterly useless. Lucky that this hallucination was minor and I had a
perfectly reasonable alternative.} 18. Qxb5 Qxb5 19. Bxb5 Rc7 {Trying to
double on the c file. After my doubts, I now feel I have dynamic equality at
worst and am probably a good bit better. My king is not getting checkmated and
his structure is now awful with a bad bishop to boot.} 20. Rfc1 Rfc8 21. Rxc7
Rxc7 22. Bd3 {Better was Bf1 right away I think. I can't fight for the c file
just yet.} Rc3 23. Bf1 Nb8 24. g3 {My plan is now very simple, go after the f4
pawn!} Nc6 25. Bh3 Kf7 26. Nh4 Ne7 {That plan is foiled, but the advantage is
that his pieces are really tied down. I can't walk my king in as Ng6 would
spoil everything and then some. So now I have a new plan. A second minority
attack of sorts. I want to  push my pawn to h5, then swing my rook to the b
file and pressure b7.} 27. a4 Bd7 28. a5 Ke8 29. Rb1 Rc7 {And his rook has
everything covered. The next move he covers it even more stopping a6 even
further. I am at this point just kind of lost, but not willing to accept a
draw, and start to improve my pieces in miniscule ways as he can't really move
much either.} 30. Kg2 Bc8 31. Rb2 Rc4 32. Ra2 {Rb5 to maybe eventually c5 was
a consideration but I rejected it as it felt risky somehow.} Kd8 33. Kf3 Rc1
34. Bg2 Kc7 35. Ke2 Bd7 {I thought this was not a great move by my opponent. I
now have stumbled upon a suspect plan but still better than no plan at all. I
simply want to get rid of his one good piece by swapping rooks. This carries
some risk, including the threat of him being able to get enough pawns off to
possibly force me into an infamous knight + bishop ending which I cannot do.}
36. Kd2 Rc4 37. Rc2 Bb5 38. Rxc4+ {And here I think i blundered, or at least
was not careful. My opponent was down to 7 minutes where I still had 45. I
assumed he would take with the bishop hence the previous move, but I was
afraid of dxc4 which in some lines would be scary for me if he could connect a
couple of pawns.} Bxc4 39. Bh3 Kc6 40. Bxf5 {Maybe taking with the knight is
better, but i had calculated this line, and I figured if the knight didnt take
on f5 my h pawn would be way too fast , and if the knight takes, I had
calculated the following line which was played in the game.} Nxf5 41. Nxf5 Kb5
42. Nd6+ Kxa5 43. Nxb7+ Kb4 44. Kc2 {The a pawn is dangerous, but sort of like
a wrong bishop and rooks pawn ending, My king alone can cover it. Normally I'd
want my king in the action but I'm hoping my knight can do some work here. I
think this was not a great plan. It's also at this point that I fully realize this feels like a 12 round boxing match and I'm in round 8 having hit a wall.} a5 45. Kb2 a4 46. Nd6 a3+ 47. Ka1 Kc3 48. Ne8
f5 49. Nd6 Bd3 {This move should have been obvious to me but it wasn't. I
burned a good amount of time here to figure out what exactly I was going to do.
I realized I must take the a pawn to force his king into an irrevocable
decision.} 50. Ka2 Kd2 51. Kxa3 Ke2 52. Kb4 Kxf2 53. Kc5 Be4 {And I had seen
this position in my calculations which is good, but what is not good is that I
had thought Nxe4 just wins. It only draws. On my bad days i woulda played Nxe4
thinking it was still winning. It wasn't. It's a small sign of maturity that I
am maybe checking this more closely, but bad that I can't calculate further
ahead. I now had to find a win. I desperately tried to make Nxf5 work 3
separate times and all failed. I triple-checked nxe4 and wondered if I could
win the queen endgame but could'nt find a way. I then was just sort of
stumbling on moves when I found g4, which is a huge resource in the position
and I am pretty sure white's only winning try.} 54. g4 fxg4 55. Nxe4+ dxe4 56.
d5 Kg2 57. d6 Kxh2 58. d7 g3 59. d8=Q g2 60. Qh4+ {I felt really good, this
should be winning!} Kg1 61. Kd4 $4 {What a huge blunder. Amazingly this didn't
cost half a point. The normal technique for winning the g pawn now doesn't
apply. I had thought about taking the e pawn, but thought that was silly and a
waste of time and might give counterplay. It turns out it's necessary if I
want to stop the g pawn.} Kf1 62. Qf4+ Ke2 63. Qg4+ Kf1 {And now I was just
cursing myself out under my breath. Qf3 in normal situations forces the king
to g1, where I can move my own king, but here is obviously impossible.} 64.
Kxe4 {I found this 2nd plan. I had no idea if it would win at the time I was
just sure it wouldn't lose and that was going to have to be good enough.} g1=Q
65. Qxg1+ Kxg1 66. Kf3 Kh2 67. Kg4 h5+ {One last move to find, I had already
seen that I had to keep opposition so that the king would be forever behind my
pawn.} 68. Kh4 Kg2 69. e4 Kf3 70. e5 {And utterly exhausted, I survived with a
win. I couldn't tell you what happened on the board left to me or two to the
right of me or nearly any in my row even though they were all finished. I told
my opponent how much respect I had for his game, and how it was the hardest I
had to work in my life. He acknowledged how brutal it was on him as well. I
thought about being a sick addict and entering the blitz tourney, but having
basically become a blunder machine nearly by the end, I thought better of it
and staggered back to my hotel happy, in love with chess and exhausted. And while it's probably untrue, I'd like to think I'd feel the same if it was a draw.} 1-0

This one makes some sense in 1 minute games, because your opponent might blunder, and has to spend time parrying threats. I wouldn't play like this myself, though, as it must give you bad habits in real time controls like 3 2.


2:  Hypermaterialism


This one makes no sense at all. There are many players that will just grab grab grab any material they see, without thinking at all. Sure, they save a bit of time not having to think, but it's bullet. Material matters less than in real games, so if anything the default decision should be to not capture material if it's potentially dubious.



3: Retarded king rushes


This one makes the least sense of all. Many players will push their king up the board even in open middlegames with queens still on the board. It's not even practical. Why are they trying to mate themselves?

Was wondering if I could get some insight from the Reddit chess community on the merits of playing lots of bullet/blitz chess, and whether it actually improves your overall game.

In particular I felt the fast time controls were only helping my chess ""reflexes"", and working well under pressure, but were doing nothing to help my overall calculation abilities. Since the nature of fast time controls means you can't calculate as deeply.

This to work on calculation abilities I think longer time controls are preferred. However: I don't have the time or patience to play a 30 min per side game. Thus I've just been doing the chess.com tactics trainer in addition to the daily (1 day) chess for now.

I started a little while ago exploring other openings but besides dubious and sometimes crazy gambits, the only openings I ever see anyone really play seriously out of 1.e4/e5 is the Ruy Lopez, or sometimes the KG.

I know fundamentally, the Ruy is more reliable in that it's slower and more positional and the Italian tends to have a few more early fireworks before fizzling out but truthfully, how far can the Italian (or at least 1.e4, 2.Nf6, 3.Bc4) take you? Within the Italian, I've learned the Fried Liver which I'll use on occasion to stave off boredom but at my level even still, it isn't too common for someone to reply 3..Bc5. So I haven't been able to really practice the Evan's Gambit all that much. 

But even still, I feel the Italian is significantly smaller in theory and strategy than other mammoths like the Ruy and that I fear it may have a ceiling. My other perspective is that perhaps (hopefully) the ceiling is quite higher than I think it is and is still of high enough quality to yield satisfactory results for my playing career.

33,"I was reading about Courier Chess on Wikipedia, and under the ""Modern rules"" stab of an article section, I read that

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_chess

&gt; Albers attempted to popularize the game in Germany in 1821 with updated rules. (...)  Castling is permitted, if all squares between the king and the rook are vacant, the king has not been checked, **the rook is not en prise**, neither has moved, and no square between them is under attack. The king moves to (...)


But I have a problem with **en prise** term. What exactly does it mean?

*****

I tried to search for it over the internet, like here:

https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/en_prise

&gt;  (of a piece or pawn) in a position to be taken.

Does it mean that a piece or pawn (doesn't matter, if defended or not, as it's position that usually matters, especially in mating sequences), that  is simply under Queen's (or other piece's or pawn's) attack, is *en prise*, if the Queen (or that piece) can legally take it, that is: can take it, without uncovering check?

Or uncovering the check doesn't matter here, so the piece or pawn is still *en prise*, even if it is not in the position to be taken?

*****

As this definition is very unclear to me, I tried again. This time with a help of Wikipedia:

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en_prise

&gt; (chess, of a piece) Undefended, able to be captured.

But looks like this one is very unclear too....

I assume that ""able to be captured"" here doesn't mean an existence of series of legal moves, in order to capture it, but more like being able to capture it in one move? Otherwise, almost everything would be *en prise*, unless the position is permanently closed by pawns.

Also, if the piece is unable to move (because it uncovers the check), does it mean that the piece it attacks is not *en prise*, because it actually can't be captured by attacking piece, as putting own King in check is illegal?


This definition also differs from the previous one by stating, that the piece being in the position to be taken is not enough, as it actually have to be undefended. 

How technically does it look like, when the defending piece is pinned and cannot move? Can pinned (because of uncover check, if it moves) piece be recognized as defending piece? Or if it's act of defending causes illegal move, it's not defending that piece anymore and ""defended"" status of previously defended piece or pawn can be disregarded here?

*****

Another explanation I found:

&gt;  Exposed to possible capture. Used of a chess piece.

https://www.thefreedictionary.com/en+prise

Which supports idea of simply being possible to capture, no matter if the piece is defended or undefended.

*****

And the same in many other places, for example here:

https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/en-prise

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/en%20prise

&gt;  of a chess piece
&gt;
&gt; : exposed to capture

*****

Finally, I read interesting explanation about this chess term from Edward Winter:

http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/enprise.html

However, what it actually does is explaining that there is much of misunderstanding about this term and that it can have more than one meaning... without actually explaining what the term means. Example of what I call here a double-meaning:

&gt; Leaving his knight at h5 *en prise*, White puts his other knight *en prise* to two pawns.

Where the first knight is ""defended"" by Queen, whilst the other one is not protected by anything. 

*****

*****

So, what does **en prise** mean? 

Does it simply mean that the piece can be captured and have nothing to do with it being protected?

Or defending actually means something here? The sources I found seem to contradict themselves...

If it's simply ability to capture a piece, then is the attacked piece *en prise*, if the only piece that could capture it would have to uncover check on own king, making the move illegal? 

In other way, if the piece is attacked, but can't be captured, is it still *en prise*?",0,[en prise] I can't find a reliable explanation about what *en prise* means anywhere. Can someone help me and bring insight on this matter?

35,"My son received a chess board for Christmas and has really been taken by the game. He's in 1st grade and my wife and I would very much like to encourage and support his growth in the game.

The problem is, we don't have the money/time resources to hook him up with a coach and his elementary school doesn't have a program. I have undertaken some learning and practicing the game, and have discovered that I think maybe I am terrible at it. I can sometimes beat or draw the lichess.org ""play the computer"" level 1, and have only beaten level 2 once out of ten games played (much to my excitement), the other nine games resulting in thorough and quick checkmates. This makes me think I am rather underqualified to really teach my kid the game.

How do I help my kid get better at something I know very little about and do not have a natural affinity for? I like the game and have enjoyed learning along with him, but I'm wondering how the community here would recommend guiding a young student of the game without leading him astray or giving him bad information since I know so little of tactics.

For my own part, should I just keep playing against level 1 until I can beat it every time and should I recommend the same to my sone, or is that not how online chess engines work? I'm very new to this world...

36,"This is my 3rd or 4th straight year of this thread. It's your chance to celebrate the best game you played of 2017 and annotate it. 

As usual, preference is for OTB games, or at least a long time control.

We've had some really good submissions in the past. I won't have much of a good one at all, this being a pretty poor year for me, dropping 20 something points to the low 1600s, choking away a pretty huge win, and of the 38 games I played, I only won 14 of them, with 12 of those 14 opponents being below me.

So with that, I'm listing what is my biggest tournament scalp ever, but really not a very impressive game from me. 

On a related note, when people usually ask what happened when you beat your highest rated opponent, most people list some brilliant attacking game or some really cool sacrifice. Me? for the 2nd straight time in a rated game, it mostly involves my opponent being up material and up on the position and just somehow just having a melt down and playing much worse than their rating. 

On to the game. no engines are used in my analysis.

importantly the position is now open meaning my not great pieces look much
worse given my lack of time to re-route them. Putting my bishop back on f8 is
absoutely unplayable as my king is stuck in the center. f6 rips open the
position to my disadvantage i think. A trade of bishops puts my king on e7
which seems like an unpleasant way for it to die. So, down a pawn, I held my
nose and traded queens, which violates every chess principle you learn past

37,"Earlier this morning, I decided to go to a local park that has an area with permanent chessboards where a lot of people like to play chess. It was actually a very nice day out, especially considering its winter. There was another guy there as well and I started a conversation with him. He seemed like a nice guy and he asked me if I wanted to play a game of chess, no time limits, just a casual game.

I accepted and explained that I was actually quite new to the world of chess and that I wasn't very good. He confessed that he isn't very good either, and that perhaps we could learn from each other. He also proposed that to make it more interesting, there should be stakes involved. We decided to pool all of the money we had with us, winner takes all. 

I put in about $112 dollars and he had about 90 something, it came out to a little over $200. I was a bit nervous about the money, but I felt fairly confident that there was a decent chance I could win since I've been practicing quite a bit. I got kind of excited when I saw how much the pool added up to. Anyway, he ended up winning, obviously, but I'd like to share the game we played and share what analysis I could come up with.

41,"Both these defences are [IMHO] used by grandmasters if they feel like they need a draw, to increase their drawing chances. But i feel like the are slightly different, as i understand it the Berlin gives slightly more chances for black due to imbalances, like Bishop pair vs knight + bishop, opposite pawn majority, but as the queens are off the board it can become slightly more drawish.

Petrov's defence if i understand it right, gives black a symetrical position. But because white has better piece placement and development black can get slightly cramped, so it is slightly more drawish than berlin, but with less chances for black.

I have also tried to format it as best I can, but nonetheless I think it is a good/entertaining game that I would very much appreciate if at least one person reviewed the game in order to facilitate my chess improvement journey.

I decided to give some thought to studying a chess opening, (not the typical way to improve if you're 1300ish) mainly because I never really make to the end game.... so why practice it lol. I studied some of the french defence and I think it helped for this game. Thanks very much if you decided to review this game.

The above is from [Strong and Weak Pawns by Natalia Pogonina](https://www.chess.com/article/view/strong-and-weak-pawns). One of the problems in trying to learn/improve is I don't think the folks rated 2400+ that are writing these helpful guides recognize that, for players rated 1/2 their rating, things obvious to them are not obvious to us. ""Black won't be able to play b5 for a while due to the threat of e5."" This is said without explanation, so taken to be obvious.

The preceding information in the article was pretty basic stuff, I've reasonably understood for awhile, so the article seems aimed at players at or below my skill level. Is it obvious to most low-level players why e5 is a threat in this position if Black's pawn has been moved to b5? I can see b5 not being useful because White can play ab, and Black's a6 pawn would be (at the moment) pinned. But where does White's threat of playing e5 become the reason not to play b5?

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate all the talented players that take the time to put together these articles, but what they often imply as obvious just isn't for me. If it's obvious to other players at my level, I'd like to sort out how to close the gap.

68,"This is a game I just played over the weekend at the DuPage County Chess Championship in Chicago. I was playing up in the U1600 section. The games were 45 minutes with a 5 second delay. I am a mere 1303 while my opponent was 1487. My mindset for this game was to get to an even middle game and outplay him positionally for a drawn out win. 

Here's the LiChess Link: https://lichess.org/study/diNh3Zfk

1. e4 c6 {I always play the Caro-Kann against e4, I know the themes of the opening like the c5 pawn push, get my Queen's Rook to c8, and push on the Queen side}

2. d3 d5 {Admittedly I was already out of book, I'd never seen d3 before. Seemed too passive to me b/c it doesn't establish any control in the center and blocks in White's Light Squared bishop, I figured d5 was logical by staking a claim to e4 and d5 contesting white's e4 pawn}

3. Nd2 e6 {Nd2 seemed like a poor move to me. It blocks in White's Dark Squared Bishop, but it does eye e4 and c4. In hindsight, I should have played e5 controlling more of the center. I figured to play solid and defend d5, despite feeling like I should have punished White for their passive move}

4. Ngf3 Nd7 {White develops the Knight, is now closer to castling, controls e5 &amp; d4. Nd7 with the idea of the c5 push coming in the near future}

5. e5 Ne7 {White expands their pawn center with d4 coming next I assume unblocking their Light Squared Bishop and establishing White's King Side Spacial Advantage. I like Ne7 because after the c5 push the Knight will have a nice home on c6 adding to my Queenside advantage}

6. d4 c5 {White now cements their pawn center and unblocks the LSB. c5 undermines their pawn center allows Nc6 and then the DSB has an open diagonal as well}

7. c3 cxd4 {White defends d4 and after the exchange maintains their pawn center, thus now I'm eyeing a future pawn break with f6. I felt like my position was getting rather cramped so I decided to liberate my pieces with the pawn exchange and now can place my Q &amp; R on the open c-file}

8. cxd4 Nc6 {White simply recaptures keeping their pawn center. I swung my Knight to the Queen side where my play should be focused due to my d5-e6-f7 pawn chain 'pointing' to the Queen side. Also now my DSB can be developed}

9. g3 Be7 {White's plan is clear to fianchetto their Bishop. I thought he would play Bd3 with the Bishop having clear diagonals to both sides of the board. This was the only good square for my Bishop and I am now prepared to castle..Bb4 runs into a3 and I have to retreat to e7 anyway}

10. Bg2 0-0 
11. 0-0 Qb6 {After we both retreat our Kings to safety, I know White's backward pawn on d4 should be a target I aim for. With my Knight on c6 already eyeing it Qb6 adds a second attacker. d4 is currently only defended once so White has to defend it. I figured his response would be Nb3 making d4 triple defended. But I could now push a5 threating a4 to force the Knight out of b3 and back to d2 losing the pawn on d4. So White would respond to a5 with a4 now losing control over b4 which would be a great outpost for my Knight deep in White's territory}

12. Nb3 a5
13. a4 f6 {I figured Nb4 is always going to be there for me since it's controlled by my a-pawn, N on c6 and my DSB so I decided to initiate the pawn break now}

14. Be3 fxe5 {I did not see Be3 admittedly. Meaning after the pawn exchange White gains a tempo on my Queen. fxe5 breaks up White's control over the center and opens the file for my Rook}

15. Nxe5 Ndxe5 {White probably wanted to open up his position for his LSB. I had a long think here between which Knight to recapture with. I ultimately decided on the N on d7 because I still can play Nb4 and if I recaptured with the N on c6 but then the N on d7 doesn't have many good squares to go to}

16. dxe5 Qd8 {When analyzing my game I see that Qb4 should have been played could follow up with Bc5 and try to eliminate White's best piece, their DSB}

17. f4 Bd7 {White defends e5 and possibly starts a Kingside pawn storm. I had to develop my Bishop and get it into the game}

18. h4 Rc8 {White continues with their Kingside pawn storm. From the Jeremy Silman books I've read one thing I'll always remember is when there are opposite side of the board attacks don't be the first player to give in. So I carried on with my Queenside attack and control the c-file}

19. Rc1 Nb4 {White blinks first and responds to my plan. I now plant my Knight in White's territory and challenge for the c-file. After the exchange my a-pawn will be undefended by his Knight will be very poorly placed and can be targeted for an attack on a5}

20. Rxc8 Qxc8
21. Nxa5 Bc5 {I was very surprised he went for the pawn capture. In retrospect, the simple b6 is maybe better but I felt like his DSB was controlling a strong, long diagonal and I wanted to trade it off for mine. Bc5 works b/c not only does it pin his Bishop to his King but he can't recapture without losing his Knight (Bxc5 Qxc5 Kg2 Qxa5}

22. Bf2 b6 {White must move his Bishop since it's undefended. I thought he'd play Bd4 so the recapture places his Queen in the center. But after Bf2, I attack the Knight and support my c5 Bishop. So White's Knight must retreat to b3 where Bxa4 will pin it to his Queen}

23. Nb3 Bxa4 
24. Bxc5 bxc5 {Qxc5 loses to Nxc5 Bxd1 Rxd1 and I now have connected passed pawns}

25. Qf3 Qc7 {White eliminates the pin and maintains the defense of his Knight. I want to get my Queen to Qb6 to threaten the discovered check c4+. This also allows my Rook full mobility of the back rank}

26. Bh3 Qb6 {White just forces my Queen to where I wanted to go anyway. Also if I play c4 my Queen prevents the Knight from going to d4}

27. Kg2 c4 {White moves out of the way of the discovered check. I gain a tempo on White's Knight which must retreat backwards and push one of passed pawns closer to promotion}

28. Nc1 d4 {I noticed White's Queen and King are on the same diagonal so I could win his Queen with Bc6 which d4 allows on top of pushing my passed pawns closer to promotion. Also at this point we are both under time pressure with about 3 minutes to go each}

29. b3 Bc6 {He clearly doesn't see my Bc6 threat}
30. Bxe6+ Kh8
31. Bxc4 Bxf3+ {White loses his Queen for a Bishop &amp; 2 pawns}
32. Rxf3 Qc6 {I instantly play this to pin his Rook to his King. I definitely overlooked Nc2 which threatens both Ne1+ &amp; Ne3+}

33. e6 Re8 {I put my Rook in front of his passed pawn. I thought about Nd5 blocking his Bishop and threatening Ne3+ forking his Bishop as well}

34. Kf2 Qd6 {White moves out of the pin &amp; I defended my passed pawn. I was probably playing a little too fast at this point but I only had a minute to go}

35. f5 Nd5 {White defends his passed pawn and I eyed playing Ne7 to control the square in front of the passed pawn which you must do to combat it}

36. Nd3 Ne7 {The drawback of Nd5 is that it allowed White's Knight to get back into the center. I halt the passed pawn with Ne7}

37. b4 Rf8 {White pushes another passed pawn. I now double attack White's f-pawn planning that with a g4 response I can play Qh2+

38. g4 Black loses on Time

I thought I played a very strong game but under time pressure I resorted to simply responding to my opponent's moves. Instead, being up a Queen for a Bishop &amp; 2 Pawns I should have put the pressure on him and make him respond to my threats.

I appreciate any and all comments.

As the attacker of the isolated pawn, place a knight or minor piece in front of the pawn and continue to support it. 

My question is, what if your opponent instead chooses to attack the pawn directly and pushing the pawn would be detrimental? Would you switch focus to protecting the pawn directly, or let it go and focus efforts elsewhere? What if you don’t have the option to push the pawn due to it being blockaded in addition to being attacked? Where does play go from there?",0,IQP positions?

16 Ne4 Qxa2 I wanted to move the knight obviously, but keep it central. In turn this blocked my queen and rook behind it out, but I planned to move it next move. This left my a2 pawn hanging, a move proving to be very game changing.

25 Rc2 Be6 

26 c4 Qa5+ I moved the pawn to give a chance for the knight to go to c3 and prevent the pawn from promoting on b1 as an extra precaution. This also blocked the bishop that was threatening.

27 Ke3 Nf5+ 28. Ke2 Qa3 (he went for the fork not seeing my knight) 

29 Nc3 Nd4+ 30. Nxd4 O-O 

31 Nf3 Rb3 Moved the knight because I thought it could be able to go to d2 and threaten the pawn? im not sure exactly, I messed that one up.

32 Nd1 Bf5 at this point I saw his intention to take with the bishop on d3

33 Nxb2 Bxd3+ I decided to take to gain material by taking and defend d3, but I did not realize once he takes if I were to move the knight I would have lost my queen.

34 Nxd3 Rxb1 I realized here that it was not so bad to lose the queen for a rook and the bishop, and it would equalize us material wise. I'd end up in a better position than just giving up the rook.

I've recently these last few months turned into a chess player through trying new things out and I'm massively enjoying it so far! I've even taken over running the chess club at the School I teach at :) Even though I'm not naturally great, its such a fun challenge.

I've looked at lots of content online and advice on how to get better, and one of the big ones is that I've seen is to pick your openings, stick to them and learn them. In vein of that I've been playing the Caro Kann as black against 1.E4 to great success. I love the opening. However I'm really unhappy with my choices so far as white and responding to 1.D4 :/

I've tried 1.C4 and KIA but both seem like they aren't quite working or at least I've not got the pattern they hold like the Caro Kann does in my head yet :L 

I'm actually find it much easier at the moment playing black and countering my opponents plans and responding to them as opposed to naturally creating attacks or plans as white :l

Would it be possible to get any opinions on openings I should check out and any advice in general? I'm hovering around 1650-1700 on LiChess in 10+0 Rapid category at the moment, and would love to improve!

So if I elect to just play double fianchetto, it feels like I'm saying ""No, I'm not playing your opening. I'm playing MY opening.""

Might just be statistical noise I suppose, but it seems to me that sometimes I'll be playing 1k to 1.2k players and be on a fairly even playing field: gaining some rating, but most of the games seem to be fairly even matched. 

Other times, I just get freaking schooled. Not just taking advantage of my blunders, but situations that seem like they require more setup than I'll have skill to see (3-4 moves ahead mid-game, multiple options with the line to attack, etc..) 

Not just basic stuff like clever pins, but very not obvious strategies that I can figure out after but would have no way of seeing during such a short time format. 

Also, I play 2-1 most frequently and these players do these setups quickly and during analysis, sure, they do not make all the best moves but it seems like they are way above my skill.

Instead of retreating their bishop or taking on c3, they sacrifice a piece because they are too offended to lose a tempo.

In the game, I played solid positional chess and managed to reach an endgame a pawn up (N + 6P vs B + 5P). Eventually, we reached this position, white (me) to move:

https://i.imgur.com/qNInM8c.png

Of course this shouldn't be that hard to convert, I can defend the pawn with Nc4 and then bring my king up - I don't have too much to worry about since he can only control half of the squares. At the very worst it should be a draw if I mess something up. Instead, I ended up losing after playing h3 in the position shown - the terrible thing is that even after h3 it should be a draw, but I defended horribly and lost a K+3P each side endgame. 

This isn't even the worst example. Later in the same tournament, playing white, I had this position against a 1600, white to move:

https://i.imgur.com/snxQUtD.png

In case you're curious, stockfish evaluates this as +52 for white. Needless to say, I somehow ended up losing. I don't even remember what I played here, I had stopped taking notation due to time and I prefer to forget everything about this tournament.

Granted, I was in moderate time trouble in both of these, but so were my opponents so that isn't an excuse. Also, these are just today's examples - so many of my recent losses have been due to similar endgame ineptness in positions I should win. 

Has anyone else had problems like this and managed to fix them? I seriously feel like my Elo in endgames is about 100, and this seems to be the major thing holding me back from reaching the next level - I seem reasonably competent at tactics and positional play, at least for my rating. I've considered getting an endgame book, but these seem to be more about memorizing specific endgames than being able to calculate arbitrary non-theoretical positions.

82,"Hi r/chess,

I've recently taken up the hobby with a Squareoff board I got for Christmas, so my knowledge is at a novice level. For those who aren't familiar, it's a board with automated parts that moves the other side's pieces on its own. It works with an AI system to know where to move. 

The reason I explain this is because there may be something wrong with the system that's causing this, but I'm pretty sure it's just my ignorance of the game.

As you can see in the picture ([Here](https://i.imgur.com/DZUzkPv.png)), I had just moved my queen from h5 to h6, thinking that this would cause a checkmate because anywhere the opponent's king would move next would allow me to capture the piece. Instead, the AI claim that the game had ended in a draw. 

Can someone explain for me why this is? Kent the king legally move to another Square, meaning that I should win the game? The way I understood it was that as long as the opponent has a legal move to make, it's not a draw.

At one point the guest, that was part of the Deep Blue team, said that Kasparov was (is?) known for his poor handling of losses. Finding all the possible excuses to say, in short ""I lost, but it was not my fault, rather it was the factor X or Y"".

Now for the little that I know, in a competitive environment, be it chess, the job market, starcraft or whathever, there are plenty of people that are ""faster"" than others. That is, that are talented and thus they can progress faster than others. Nonetheless they won't reach very high skill levels if they won't work on their skill, learning from mistakes, preventing future errors and so on. Thus I would expect, especially from top players, something the like ""Yes, I didn't play well in the match, I'll analyse it to not repeat the same mistakes"" rather than using an external factor as scapegoat.

For my memories Carlsen does that often, he loathes himself rather than saying things like ""it was that (external) factor that distracted me or that determined my loss, I would have played perfectly otherwise"".

**Tl;DR**: thus my question is, how come that Kasparov (and others?) could reach so high level of competition without focusing on their mistakes, trying to eliminate them?

37,"I listened to the episode 104 of Perpetual Chess podcast (it is on youtube), with GM J. Benjamin. 

In this subreddit and I guess on the internet, when one discuss about the GOAT, there is always a vocal group of people (a minority?) that says that chess was harder in the past. For example the Soviet Union (SU) founded chess like crazy and the talent of the past won't be replicated nowadays because no one is pushed to his limits.

Well Joel Benjamin was there in the 80s and 90s and he says that the players in the SU were indeed strong, but aside from the very top, they couldn't travel. Thus in the west a good player had not much competition and could even demand appearance fees. Nowadays instead there are strong players from everywhere (Europe, East Europe, China, India, South east asia and other places), especially because the border with East Europe collapsed, thus it is unlikely to get privileges and every slightly attractive tournament is no walk to the park.

I wanted to report his view because to me it is obvious that after the slup in the 90s (the SU dissoluting and East Europe being not so politically stable) nowadays chess worldwide is super competitive, already thanks to online competition that may help finding players with a lot of potential, matching them with the game. 

That is: a player plays online, likes the game and wants to get better in it; rather than never getting to know that there is a chess club near to him (if chess wouldn't be available online).",0,Listened to Joel Benjamin (US chess champion) saying that chess nowadays has much more competition.
38,"I just read the timeline on the [Wikipedia article on Computer Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess) which talks about computers winning tournaments, and competing in the same tournaments with humans. So I'm wondering how those kind of tournaments worked back then:

- How did it physically work? Was the computer's opponent expected/required to directly interact with the computer, or was there a separate ""middleman"" who plays the computer's moves on the physical chessboard, and types the opponent's moves into the computer to let the computer know what happened?
- It mentions a computer winning the Mississippi State Championship and earning a master rating. Could computers enter ""normal"" chess tournaments and freely compete with humans? Did computers exist in the same rating systems as humans?
- Could humans gain/lose ""real"" rating points by winning/losing against computers?
- Were there any players that refused to play against computers? Would those players have to forfeit and give the computer a free win / free rating points?

39,"This is a little bit of an opinion piece but I just wanted to put it out there that chess tempo standard tactics training seems way better than chess(dot)com puzzles.  I think it comes down to the following three things:

1) The tactics feel much more natural and realistic.  A lot of high rated chess(dot)com puzzles feel like they hit on obscure features of odd positions which may not be vert applicable to games.  Almost every chess tempo tactic I have worked on feels very real with common themes and great combinations.  

2) The rating and timing system seems superior on chess tempo.  On chess(dot)com, a huge part of rating depends on how fast you solve the puzzle.  At surface this might seem ok, but it actually engrains bad analysis by jumping to conclusions and not thinking lines all the way out to the end.  I try not to think about the time, but the large timer in your face and getting like 1 point for taking 10 minutes and 15 points for taking 30 seconds definitely influence you at some level if you are trying to work your way up to harder problems.  I find myself on chess(dot)com solving maybe 10 problems in a row correctly taking 5 minutes per problem and then losing all the progress I made with one failed tactic.  Also chess(dot)com puzzle ratings seem way inflated.  

3) Chess tempo is free! How great is that.  It's such a valuable problem set and I'm grateful they don't charge for it.  If I ever make it to NM I will be sure to donate or subscribe.  

Because of these 3 factors, I never really felt I got much out of tactics training.  I recently discovered chess tempo tactics and have now put in an hour a day for the past 2 weeks.  I went from my chess(dot)com analysis of quickly jumping to lines and making mistakes to thoughtful, considerate analysis that is actually going to improve my play.  I went from maybe getting 60% of tactics correct to about 80% with my new calculation.  I am much more confident already in my vision and ability to calculate.

I play once a week at a club but the skill level there is very wide and I don't always get to play the stronger players(I'm sure they feel the same way about playing me that I feel about playing novices). I've started listening to the perpetual chess podcast (which is excellent) and it's gotten me very interested in developing my skills so I was hoping someone on here had experience with a systematic way to improve from here. I know I can do tactics and study endgame but it's challenging to find things that are at the right level and the time I should spend on them before moving on.

56,"Quick background: First day on the sub. I've played chess since an early age but I had to drop it when I switched schools as a kid. Got re-introduced to it via agadmator's chess channel some time last year and have been pretty regular with some puzzles every day since. My puzzle rating on lichess is 1550 ish with a peak in the 1690s and I'm currently focusing on the London system as white and Kings Indian as black.

Here's the problem. As a kid, I learned chess without the concept of a clock. When I got back into chess, I continued to play without a clock. I am now in this spot where I have a mental block against the clock to the point that I get scared. Not of the opponent or making mistakes but of running out of time, even in a 15+15 classical format (though that has never happened, the few times that I have tried)

I get that the best thing to get over this would be to literally just play any games. Rated/unrated or classical/rapid/blitz, just ""get over it"" but I find that it takes the fun out of chess for me and it takes a LOT of will power and I'm never focusing as well on the position itself because I'm constantly in a rush. I'll still do it every now and then to test myself but I was hoping somebody on here might have suggestions for me. If not, how do you manage your time in games?",0,How do I embrace the clock?

Hello dear friends,


As the title says, I haven't played any tournaments in a long time, due to health problems (I am currently fine). On July, there is a U1700 tournament in my country, just before moving abroad. My FIDE Elo in classical is 1495 right now; however, the last tournament I played all the players were above 1900 elo, I managed to draw against a FM with 2150~ elo, and I had very close games against the other players. I quit playing in 2018 and 2019, but now it's my oportunity to have a good result in a tournament.

Due to University starting next week, I won't have too much time, the most I can get is 1-2 hours per day on weekdays and 4-8 hours on Saturdays/Sundays.


Has anyone been in the same situation as me? What kind of training would you recommend me doing? Any feedback is appreciated.

1. How should I analyse my games?
2. How long/deep should each analysis be?
3. How do I find my mistakes when analysing?
4. When/How should I use computer analysis?

If I had to answer these questions, here would be how I would answer it. What do you think about it?:

1. I would go on [https://lichess.org/study/mine/hot](https://lichess.org/study/mine/hot) and create a study. Then, I would go through the game and write down comments as if I was explaining my thoughts to another person. I would also (sometimes) show other moves that I feel is better.
2. How long? I don't know, it just depends. How deep? As deep as I can (I won't try to go TOO deep into the analysis, but I will at least type a few paragraphs and make a few arrows)
3. IDK. Whatever mistake I find, I just write down.
4. When? After doing my (probably not-so good) research, I found out that I should not use the computer analysis until I have done my own analysis. How? IDK. I guess to see which moves I blunderred in, and see what I might have missed.

Here is one analysis I did, not sure what you will think of it, perhaps even critique it: [https://lichess.org/study/YKfLpRCk/Doz8AjIx](https://lichess.org/study/YKfLpRCk/Doz8AjIx)

1. Nf3 d5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. d4 Nc6 4. Bf4 e6 5. e3 Bb4 6. a3 Ba5 7. Bb5 Ne4 8. O-O Nxc3 9. bxc3 Bxc3 10. Rb1 Qd7 11. Ne5 Qe7 12. Nxc6 Qxa3 13. Nxa7+ Bd7 14. Bxc7 Rxa7 15. Bb6 Ra5 16. Bxa5 Qxa5 17. Qd3 Qc7 18. e4 O-O 19. exd5 exd5 20. Rb3 Ba5 21. c4 Re8 22. Rbb1 Qf4 23. Bxd7 Re7 24. g3 Qg4 
  
I have a question about key moments. There are times when the engine flags a mistake, and upon looking at the suggested ""best move"", it doesn't seem to be a great move?  
  
For example, on move 14, when I played Bxc7, the engine suggests I play Bxd7+, however the King can take on the next move.  
  
How deep does the engine look when suggesting alternate moves on Key Moments? Just trying to understand how much I should read into those moves and also the game accuracy (which was listed as 37.2 in this game). I was happy that I didn't have any blunders or missed wins, but trying to cut down on mistakes and inaccuracies as well.",0,chess.com: Key Moments?

41,"Maybe some of you can relate with this and even provide an explanation towards why it is like this. 

This is actually a question that has lingered in my mind for a bit, but today it became very apparent. I am watching Daniel Naroditsky play and noticed that a lot of times i instinctively gravitate towards the same moves he will play.

Of course he’s a very instructive player and explains his thought process a lot, but the same thing happens then. It’s like when i watch him, we’re on the page most of the times. And this happens with him, the chessbrahs, basically anyone i watch. Same goes when analysing games or watching analysis by guys like agadmator or the Saint louis chess lectures. 


I simply see much stronger moves much more often than when i play my own games. I am hovering around the 1870-1950 rating range in both rapid and bullet on lichess and play rather confidently at an estimated FIDE rating of 1600 in longer games (according to my coach). 

However the moves i see when i spectate chess are simply better. I mean when you watch chess being played you kind of play the game too, trying to look for the best moves and estimating the position. I mean that’s what makes spectating chess fun in the first place. 
But while i “play” along these GM games, it seems like i make a lot less blunders and play better moves. It seems like my positional understanding is a lot better when i spectate chess. 

Does anyone relate to this or is it a placebo kind of effect even?

I have not learned any theory so far. I only train tactics (1800 at [chess.com](https://chess.com/) tactics). As white, I always play E4, then F3, and bishop C4/C3, then I castle.

Of course the giuoco is a popular options for those starting out, but I want something aimed at those who already know the basics and want to advance their understanding.

98,"I'm looking to improve my slow chess calculation. My coach and I agree that it's the weakest part of my game. In general, my strategic play is very good. I nearly always win the opening (even if I haven't studied this line) and get a good position. Then, I'm happy to grind it out, but then usually lose because I miscalculate something or miss an opportunity from my opponent. I need to be more solid with my calculations. I don't think I need to go that deep to improve (but that'd help), but I often miss opponent resources on move 2-4 of my calculations.

My goal is to get to 2000 USCF once covid is over (I've only played on rated game in Jan before the shutdowns).

Ideas on how I could improve:

1. Keep doing tactics. Currently, I'm 2400 on [chess.com](https://chess.com) but the puzzles take me 2-5 mins to solve now. I have no idea if this is a good rating or not...does this indicate my weakness? What are other strong players rated?
2. Solve endgame studies. I've been doing this a bit. Usually they are a bit too hard, but I do manage to correctly calculate a lot of lines pretty deeply. The problem is that I find it much harder in the middlegame when there are more pieces.
3. Force my opponents to play closed positions. Not an option in my mind. My goal isn't to win chess games, it's to improve at chess. I want to improve all aspects of my game.
4. Solve difficult middlegame positions. I have a bunch from my coach. See below for more details.
5. Play more long time control games. I spend most of my time playing 15+10 or 30 min games. Obv, I play some blitz too and know that's not helping me but I spend most of my time on long controls. Maybe I should try to find some longer time control games?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example of a position from my coach which I just completely failed at:

2r2rk1/1bqn2pp/p3p3/1p1pp3/1P1B4/P1N3Q1/B1P3PP/3RR1K1 w - - 0 1 ([https://lichess.org/analysis/standard/2r2rk1/1bqn2pp/p3p3/1p1pp3/1P1B4/P1N3Q1/B1P3PP/3RR1K1\_w\_-\_-\_0\_1#0](https://lichess.org/analysis/standard/2r2rk1/1bqn2pp/p3p3/1p1pp3/1P1B4/P1N3Q1/B1P3PP/3RR1K1_w_-_-_0_1#0))

I suppose the correct answer was a candidate move, but I never managed to calculate a win. There are just too many variations and white needs to make multiple accurate moves in a row. I miss one of them and so discard the variation.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm feeling like I've hit a bit of a wall/plateau. If any strong players have advice on how to break through to the next level, I'd welcome it.

I was hoping you all might be able to share with me some chess facts or ideas that I may be able to incorporate into cookie designs that would be more than just the classic chess pieces and board; some things only hardcore chess fans would appreciate.

25,"This is a possible way to exploit the Swiss-system tournament where the pairings of each round are based on the number of points each player has earned. The idea is to forgo 1st place to make the path to 2nd or 3rd place easier. With the Swiss Gambit, ideally you get paired with easier opponents to start, and climb your way back to the top by the end of the tournament when stronger players in the lead are more likely to accept a draw. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Swiss gambit started as a joke, but it might be worth considering if there is a clear favorite to win the tournament, so that you can avoid playing him until the end of the tournament when he is more likely to accept a draw. The Swiss Gambit is good if you can evaluate that the 0.5 to 1 point you lose to start the tourney is worth the easier pairings in the following games.

For example, if you draw the first game, and win the second game because of an easier pairing you would have 1.5 points out of 2. If you win the first game and lose the second game because of the more difficult pairing you would have 1 point out of 2. Obviously it's not a sporting or principled way to play a tournament, but maybe there is merit to this strategy.

88,"At about mid October last year, I hit a plateau of 1650 of Lichess. To this day, I've maintained this plateau. Have you achieved a rating between 1600 and 1700 on Lichess? Follow my advice, and I guarantee you that 3 months later you'll have the exact same rating. Here's what I did to maintain my plateau:

&amp;#x200B;

**• Study openings**

I can't stress enough how important studying openings has been to maintaining my plateau. I spend maybe 90% of my time studying openings and only 10% of my time on tactics. If you find that the majority of opening lines you study aren't played in the majority of your games then don't worry; the 10% of your time spent on tactics will cover that.

**• Engine analysis**

If you want to achieve any sort of plateau then instant engine analysis after each game is important. Did you just lose a match? Click ""request computer analysis"" and skip to your mistakes and blunders. This is all you will need for post-game analysis.

**• Buy lots of books**

It goes that say that you can't maintain a plateau without spending lots of money. When there's a sale at Everyman Chess, buy as many books as you can. Focus more on opening books and less on tactics. It doesn't matter if you don't have much time to read through all of them; chess is a lifelong journey and somewhere down the line I'm sure you'll end up reading some of them. At least that's what you have to tell yourself.

**• Play vs the computer**

Do you want a training partner stronger than Magnus Carlsen? Look no further than stockfish 10. Learn how to play a flawless game by playing against a computer engine the majority of the time.

**• Ask the community**

My final point is that [r/chess](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess) is a great community to ask questions. It's always wise to seek help from other players. For an idea of the sorts of questions you can ask the community, click the following link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/faq).

66,"I started playing around 2 months ago and I'm completely addicted. I probably average around 100 bullet/blitz games a day on lichess and I've got to a decent rating of 3300. When I started playing, it was a way to procrastinate at elementary school but now I've finished 5th grade and need to start looking at getting a job and my main concern is how a job will take away from how much time I play chess and snort cocaine. I have no interest in real life activities, it's purely chess and cocaine.

The other day my cousins came to our house and chess came up. Some kid's mom said how her kid is good at chess, he beat his dad or something and she wanted me to play him. The kid didn't know what ratings were and probably played chess twice in his life so he was a complete beginner. He'd also never snorted a line.

And when I played him, the unthinkable happened. I took his queen with my h pawn and maybe this is because I'm not used to a real board as much or I just assume he blundered but I completely missed an enpassant and this little 10ish year old beginner snorts 4 lines so I had to resign (because there was only a knight on the board, I don't even know what happened to the kings).

We played again and only around 10 moves went by before his parents said that they were losing their buzz and I was a piece up and completely winning but we called it a draw and that's all that anybody will remember, is that I passed out on the floor when playing against this little kid.

And people in my family didn't take my cocaine hobby seriously before this but now they really don't take it seriously. Like if I tell a family member that I beat a GM online they'll say ""now you just have to beat our dog"" and it's really really annoying because even when I'm messed up I don't hurt animals. I'm not usually one to get angry but this makes me very angry. It makes me feel like a bit of a loser because I invest so much time into this hobby. I can snort 7 lines at a time, nobody can keep up with me. And it's made me realize that I probably take chess way too seriously if I'm this bothered by it and I need to snort more cocaine so that I don't pass out on the floor again.

Is there a point to continuing and taking it this seriously? I've peaked at 3300 for like three days now and I'm struggling to improve. I know there aren't many titled players who started in elementary school and I've sort of deluded myself into thinking I could be one. I'm 3300 FIDE and 4100 is such a long way away because my cocaine allows me to play games so fast.",1,Should I take chess less seriously if I'm addicted to cocaine?

Have  any other Lichess overachievers ever felt this way before? It's like my elo is strapped to my waist and now whenever people are at risk of passing me on the sidewalk, they skirt over to the other side in a tizzy.

At work, someone tried to shoplift some Almond Joy. When I caught him, I yelled ""hey!""

And he looked at me and scoffed, like, ""whatever dude, don't be a hero.""

I put a hand on my hip and said ""I'm not a hero, I'm a 1500 elo chess player.""

He dropped the candy bar and ran to his getaway vehicle. I recorded the plate and called the police.

The  police and I had a long discussion about what happened; to my  understanding, I previously did not have an accolade or accessory to  mark my razor-sharp intelligence and reaction times. The officers  claimed nothing like me has ever rolled into their jurisdiction and  politely asked me to register my elo as a firearm--because my  strategic mind is as dangerous, maybe more dangerous, than most  ballistic weapons. Thought waves travel faster than the speed of light.

It's  really awkward to go from your average Chess player on track to his  pro career to a dangerous individual that others both run from and hide  behind in times of strife. Guess I'll need to get used to it... once I  hit 1700, I'll have to start leaving my computer in a gun safe at  night.",1,"Just hit 1500 and I feel really dangerous IRL, like my new elo is a concealed carry and other people can see it bulging around my waist and are scared of me now"

SO I said I didn't know how to say it in English.) What my phone number was? (I ignored it.)

Here is why I don't think he has good intentions.

1. Why would you lie to someone who you would want to be best friends? They will one day find out, so why? Just why?
2. Why would you want my phone number. Why didn't he just caht via the chat box in lichess?
3. It was so random. He was even ignoring me sometimes when I told him what I had learnt. I told him that I was conversationally fluent but didn't know some words.

75,I am very good chess player I am 1800 lichess and can win anyone in the world in single game. What chess book should I read? Could you please recommend the books from the FAQ and the same books you recommended the last 1000 times someone asked? Could you also please have a pretentious conversation about why the books are good? Then I'll know you are good chess player too. God bless with true.,1,What chess book should I buy?
76,Whenever I play against my brother he always looks at the board and thinks while it’s my turn so he effectively gets double my time. He’s so blatant about it I’ll straight up accuse him of planning when it’s MY turn and he ADMITS it! And this is even harder to detect online!!

89,"Mark this down as one of those ""inspirational"" posts for adult chess players. I always knew how to play chess, but slightly too well, and when I started playing online in 2017, my rating quickly skyrocketed. Frustrated, I began working on the basics - blundering pieces, making sure not to control the center, etc. 1,700 ten minute games later, I'm now ranked below 826.

For many here, this is not much of an accomplishment. But for me, chess is mostly a way to relax. I don't study openings and I mostly play in the morning or when I'm winding down for the day. For me, my regression is an example of how remarkable the human brain is - through hundreds of games of trial and error, I slowly worsened without much conscious thought. My brain has forgotten at least the most obvious patterns and I know intuitively where to hang a piece. Pretty amazing!

For any beginners out there, I know what it feels like to be slightly better than you would prefer. (For some here, my rating means I'm still too good, but regardless..) Keep on plugging away at it! I enjoy chess more now than I did four years ago!",1,From 1317 to 826 ELO
90,,1,Let's start having respectful in-game conversations
91,,1,Opponent has sexy time mid game
92,,1,"Beginner here, managed to get my first pin with a bishop :)"
93,"**Bishop**: F Tier

Bishops can only ever reach half the board, making them useless. Don't want a dark square bishop to kill you? Simply hop onto a light square! Should only be used in casual games, or as a joke. 

**King**: D Tier

The King is far more prone to getting checkmated than all of the other pieces and, unlike the Pawn, it cannot promote to a Rook.

**Queen***: C Tier

The Queen's only good move, ""The Queen's Gambit"" is easily countered by your opponent simply saying ""No"", after which you are, legally, no longer allowed to gambit them. Still effective against beginners who don't know they're allowed to decline the gambit. 

**Pawn**: B Tier

Pawns are not all that powerful at the start of the game, but since they have the potential to promote to a Rook, I have to rate them above C Tier. 

**Knight**: A Tier

The Knight is a strong piece in the hands of a good player. However, given its steep learning curve, I recommend not using your Knights until you've reached an elo of at least 2000. 

**Rook**: S Tier

Moving with the speed of a cheetah and hitting with the force of a truck, Rooks are easily the best piece in the game. Since your A and H Pawns tend to get in their way, I recommend promoting the A and H Pawns ASAP, to give your Rooks the ability to move out and dominate the game.",1,Chess Piece Tier List
